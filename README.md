# QUSS

This page and repository represent the collection of resources for Quantitative Spatial Science. This is a research group consisting of academics and students from school of Geographical, University of Bristol, who are interested in human geography, quantitative methods and spatial sciences.

We meet for an hour once a week during academic year to discuss what's new in the world of quantitative geography and get inspired by presentations from researchers within our group, but also from the outside. This page provides you with useful information such as when do we meet, where, who is talking, but also link to form where you can provide your feedback or suggestions for sessions.

## When do we meet?
We will arrange appropriate slot that fits into timetables of as many of our members as possible. 

## Where do we meet?
On the schedule below, you can see if the session is online or in person.

* Online - Please use [this Zoom link](https://bristol-ac-uk.zoom.us/j/97858763043?pwd=bVp6RmRTN1J0UE00M1NLcGpLWkFFQT09
) to log in up to 10 min before the session.
* In person - We will arrange a classroom for this purpose as soon as we know more about the timetables.

## Who will be talking?

There is 3 types of session.

1. Discussion - Before this session, we provide you with reading 1 or 2 articles related to some specific topic, new idea or emerging issue. On the session then we give 10 min overview on the reading and facilitate discussion.
2. Students Presentations - 1st year and 2nd year PhD students are required to give 30 min presentation on their research introduction and progress. In this session, each student has 20-25 min presentation followed by 5-10 min for questions. Third- or fourth-year students are not required to do this, but should feel free to arrange a slot to present about their research.
3. Solo presentations - This session consists of 1 speaker presenting on their current or past research. Usually, there is 45 min presentation followed with 15 min questions, but this is not a requirement so itâ€™s completely up to the speaker how he/she wants to use this time.

Bellow you can find schedule for this academic year.
