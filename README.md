# QuSS

This page and repository represent the collection of resources for Quantitative Spatial Science. This is a research group consisting of academics and students from school of Geographical, University of Bristol, who are interested in human geography, quantitative methods and spatial sciences. Follow the [university official web page](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/geography/research/quantitative-spatial-science/) for more information.

We meet for an hour once a week during academic year to discuss what's new in the world of quantitative geography and get inspired by presentations from researchers within our group, but also from the outside. This page provides you with useful information such as when do we meet, where, who is talking, but also link to form where you can provide your feedback or suggestions for sessions.

## When do we meet?
Wednesday lunchtimes mostly - but look out for some alternative days on the schedule from time to time!

## Where do we meet?
See the below table. 

For those we cannot physically join us, we will set up a Zoom link to log in up to 10 min before the session.

## Who will be talking?

There are three types of session.

1. Discussion - Before this session, we provide you with reading 1 or 2 articles related to some specific topic, new idea or emerging issue. During the session then we give 10 min overview on the reading and facilitate discussion.
2. Student Presentations - 1st year and 2nd year PhD students are required to give 30 min presentation on their research introduction and progress. In this session, each student has 20-25 min presentation followed by 5-10 min for questions. Third- or fourth-year students are not required to do this, but should feel free to arrange a slot to present about their research.
3. Solo presentations - This session consists of 1 speaker presenting on their current or past research. Usually, there is 45 min presentation followed with 15 min questions, but this is not a requirement so itâ€™s completely up to the speaker how he/she wants to use this time.
4. Paper review - These sessions we will hear from a group member about a new article they are working on. The paper will then be reviewed by two members of the group, providing a forum for constructive and kind commentary before peer review.
Bellow you can find schedule for this academic year.

## Suggestions, questions, and feedback

If you have a suggestion for discussion, presentation topic you are interested in, know about someone from other university you want to hear about or just want to give us some feedback send us an email to caitlin.robinson@bristol.ac.uk.
