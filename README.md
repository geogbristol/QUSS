# QuSS

This page and repository represent the collection of resources for Quantitative Spatial Science. This is a research group consisting of academics and students from school of Geographical, University of Bristol, who are interested in human geography, quantitative methods and spatial sciences. Follow the [university official web page](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/geography/research/quantitative-spatial-science/) and our [blog](https://quss.blogs.bristol.ac.uk/) for more information.

We meet for an hour once a week during academic year to discuss what's new in the world of quantitative geography and get inspired by presentations from researchers within our group, but also from the outside. This page provides you with useful information such as when do we meet, where, who is talking, but also link to form where you can provide your feedback or suggestions for sessions.

## When do we meet?

During 2024/25, the times for our seminars will vary slightly. Please be sure to check the timing for each week. We will hold seminars on:

Mondays 13:00-14:00 (Geography SR2)

## Joining online

Here is the [Zoom link](https://bristol-ac-uk.zoom.us/j/92344645473) to join online if needed. Some sessions will not be offered hybrid, while some sessions will be fully remote. Please consult the calendar here or in Outlook for more details on each week.

## Where do we meet?

See the below table.

## Session types

1.  Research presentations of fully or partially developed paper from internal and external speakers.

2.  PhD student research conversations. 1st year and 2nd year PhD students are required to give a 30 min presentation on their research introduction and progress. Each student has 20-25 min presentation followed by 5-10 min for questions. Third- or fourth-year students are not required to do this, but should feel free to arrange a slot to present about their research. irst year students are strongly encouraged to present in TB1. This is a great opportunity for new students to introduce themselves and their research interests in a relaxed environment. It is also the opportunity for everyone on the research group to extend their welcome to the new studens and to help them feel ready to kick off their PhD journey. 

3.  Discussion sessions based on readings. Before this session, we provide you with reading 1 or 2 articles related to a specific topic, a new idea or an emerging issue. On the session then we give 10 min overview on the reading and facilitate discussion.

4.  Workshops on new papers or special topics

Bellow you can find schedule for this academic year.
